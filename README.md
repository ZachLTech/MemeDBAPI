[![Status](https://uptime.lopezhome.tech/api/badge/27/status?style=for-the-badge)](https://uptime.lopezhome.tech/status/memeapi)

Just a funny API with elysiajs because bun is cool and I had this idea a while ago for fun üòÄ

## Features
- Endpoints for a funny video, picture, or a roulette between the 2
- Freedom to choose whether you want a JSON or HTML formatted response 
- Multi-meme requests for a single endpoint
- Singe page website with docs & live demo (mobile support included)
- Anti meme repetition when using the multi-meme request endpoint
- Self hostable with included Dockerfiles & docker-compose yaml
