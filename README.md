# Zach's Meme API

[![Status](https://uptime.lopezhome.tech/api/badge/27/status?style=for-the-badge)](https://uptime.lopezhome.tech/status/memeapi)

Just a funny API with elysiajs because bun is cool and I had this idea a while ago for fun ðŸ˜€

website & better readme coming soon...

## Features
- Endpoints for a funny video, picture, or a roulette between the 2
- Freedom to choose whether you want a JSON or HTML formatted response 
- Plenty of funny videos (depending on your humor I guess)

## Try It
Below are the Available API URI's you can use to try my API yourself. I'm making a frontend soon though to display this as well. Have Fun!

### For JSON Results
- [`/random/json`](https://memeapi.zachl.space/random/json)
- [`/vid/json`](https://memeapi.zachl.space/vid/json)
- [`/pic/json`](https://memeapi.zachl.space/pic/json)

- [`/random/json/x`](https://memeapi.zachl.space/pic/json)
- [`/vid/json/x`](https://memeapi.zachl.space/pic/json)
- [`/pic/json/x`](https://memeapi.zachl.space/pic/json)
### For HTML Results
- [`/random/html`](https://memeapi.zachl.space/random/html)
- [`/vid/html`](https://memeapi.zachl.space/vid/html)
- [`/pic/html`](https://memeapi.zachl.space/pic/html)

## TODO
- ~~Setup semi-public file sharing system for meme source~~
- ~~Gather, convert, and rename all memes~~
- ~~upload all media to DB of memes~~
- ~~secure DB with service restrictions~~
- ~~Setup and write endpoints / API code~~

- ~~Start on frontend~~
- ~~Shorten endpoints (already done in readme)~~
- ~~Add multi-meme requests to API for frontend~~
- Implement recursive function so /x/json/y endpoint doesn't return repeated memes
